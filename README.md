# Dry_Bean

#This is a python program created using the datasets from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset. 
#In this program I have used kmeans clusttering to group the different classes of dry beans. 
#I've also added plots for the original dataset and clusterd data set
#Users can also enter their value and check the class of the dry bean
